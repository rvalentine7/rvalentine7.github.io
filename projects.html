				<p>Edge of Infinity is a 2D puzzle game where the player has control of a various number of characters and
				must try to get them safely to the exit at the end of each level.  There are a number of hazards and obstacles
				along the way that the player will need to think around in order to advance.  This game was created in Unity with
				a group of people from VGDev (Videogame Developers).  I worked as a programmer to help code the obstacles and
				characters found in the game.</P>

			<h2>Gallipoli Model</h2>

				<p>The Gallipoli peninsula was the location of a battle in World War 1 which involved
				British, ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps), and Turkish forces.
				Gallipoli is a prime example where British and ANZAC command
				structure broke down.  Using this background, the multidisciplinary
				team of people from Engineering, International Affairs, and Computational Media wanted to see what
				outcomes would result from giving troops more autonomy in a battle.
				I primarily worked on coding the model
				while my teammates worked on figuring out what parts of the battle needed to be
				represented.  We worked together to figure out how the different elements of the
				battle would be represented in the model.</p>
				<p>
				The video shown here depicts the best case scenario we found for giving troops
				more autonomy.  The red dots on the screen are the ANZAC forces, the blue dots are
				the British forces, and the green dots are the Turkish forces.  The black triangles
				are objectives the ANZAC and British are trying to reach and the Turkish are trying
				to force the ANZAC and British off of the peninsula.

				<p>One Night Only is a board game where each player is a thief who has obtained the security codes
				to a museum.  These codes will reset soon which means the thieves have only one night to make their
				move and collect as many valuables as they can.  The thief who collects the most is declared to
				be the greatest.  Each thief is able to place traps around the museum to hamper their opponents'
				progress in an attempt to make sure he/she is declared to be the greatest thief.
				This game was created with two other people for my Game Design class.</p>

				<p>This game is a top-down shooter which requires the player to destroy the enemy base before his/her own base is destroyed.
				The enemies will adapt after each round in an attempt to counter the player's strategy.  This game was
				created alongside one other person for a project in my Game AI class.  The game was coded in Python
				using Pygame.  I coded the procedural obstacle placement, enemy movements, waypoints, and navigation mesh.</p>

				<p>Full Moon is a 2D platformer I created for my Media Device Architecture
				class.  The player controls a werewolf and must escape the dungeon.  Along
				the way, the player will encounter obstacles he/she must fight or jump over to
				advance in the levels.  The game is coded in C and uses a Gameboy emulator to run.
				I fully coded Full Moon from the ground up.</p>
